# Hi there.

My name is Bastian T. Pedersen. I'm a software engineer from Norway - I read and write code—in that order—for a living, and as a hobby.

Most of my professional experience is working with web applications. My primary area of expertise is .NET and C\#, and Vue. In my own time, I dabble in other things—some mobile app development, like [Scootbatt](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.basse.scootbatt&hl=en-US) and [ScooterHacking Utility](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sh.cfw.utility&hl=en-US), some Rust and C development.

Most of my activity on GitHub is currently focused around my private repositories. Maybe I'll make them public one day.
